# CODE CHALLENGE

This is a code challenger for OAV

## MAIN SPECIFICATIONS
- Create a NodeJs API server using Typescript
- Server should have a scheduler that checks certain folder each 5 minutes
 - If there is a file present it should be parsed, and data stored in DB (In this case it's perfectly fine that "database" is actually JSON file)
 - This file is in CSV format, and it should contain columns like Make,Model,Year,Cars sold
 - This data is considered as new data, so results should be appended to our database (JSON file)
- Server should have a controller that returns the number of sold vehicles. Users can pass in make, model, year, or any other combination to get the sum of sold vehicles.

### BONUS

- TDD approach
- E2E tests
- Autogenerated documentation

## HOW TO RUN PROYECT

Use `nodemon start` command in main proyect to run it
The routes are `/api/vehicle` and to search info `/api/vehicle?Model=Toyota`
